Wouldn't you say "murder weapon" rather that "kill weapon"

Please, Mister Hissman, what is a "kill weapon" ? I know what a "murder weapon" is but it is the first time I hear about a "kill weapon".

I think I will just proceed with my testimony.

I was looking for the murder weapon, but everything was so bloody.

Of course, I tried to avoid messing with the evidence, especially the billiard ball and the trophies, but I still stepped on some glass.

At first, I thought that I might have broken some critical piece of evidence, but it was only a shard of the broken window.

I inspected it but I assumed that the window was broken during the argument.

Anyway, I arrested Bill Hard. He was the only suspect.
