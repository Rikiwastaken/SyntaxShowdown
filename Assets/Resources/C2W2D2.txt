Sorry. I have always wanted to try that...

Can you at least try to be impartial ?

Mister Neigh, what did you say your team was ?
#a255000
The Bald Eagles ? They are the bestest of the greatest of the best !
#b105000
You sure seem to love them, but you should say "the best". That already means plenty.
#c256000
Whatever you say, Dicky-boy.

#f250000
My favourite team was up, so there was no way I would have missed it.
#g250000
The Bald Eagles. That's their name. They really are the best.
