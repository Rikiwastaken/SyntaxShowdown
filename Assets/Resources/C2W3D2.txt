That is wrong, Miss La !
#2260000
Really, now ?
#3101000
You said "I saw an man." You should have said "I saw a man", as "man" does not start with a vowel.
#4261000
Are you really interrupting me for this ? 
#5331000
Witness, Mister Shionary has every right to correct you when you are wrong, so be right !

Also, there is something else that bugs me.
#7102000
It was late at night, so everything was pitch black, right ?
#8264000
I know what you are going to say, Lawyer. How could I identify Gold if it was dark ?
#9423c20
Isn't it my job to say that ?
#a261000
Be quiet, Prosecutor.
#b260000
Yes, it was pitch black, but I know for sure that Mister Gold did it.
#c260000
Because I took a picture with my phone.
#d260000
Of course, I used a flash so the picture was bright enough.
#e260000
Trust me. In the picture, you can easily identify the man near the corpse.
#f261000
Richard Gold is you're culprit !
#g260000
How do you like that, Mister Shionary ?

(Not at all, I must say.)
