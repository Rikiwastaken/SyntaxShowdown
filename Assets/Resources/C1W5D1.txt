That is enough, your honor. I think we have heard plenty. Let's hear the verdict already.
#21000000
Wait, Ecution. I believe there is still something we must talk about.
#34200000
What is it ? No witness saw any other culprit other than Bill Hard. Give it up !
#41020000
You know what ? Maybe you're right. I'm ready to give up, but only on one condition.
#54200000
I'm listening.
#61040000
Explain one thing, and I will leave.
#74200000
Spit it out. Let's hear your condition, but know one thing. Mister Hard will sleep in a cell tonight.
#81010000
He very well might, if you can explain to me how the victim's window was broken if Bill Hard had already left !
#94230000
What ?
#a3330000
Please, explain Mister Shionary.
#b1000000
Gladly, your honor. Mister Ired heard broken glass AFTER Bill Hard left.
#c1000000
This can mean two things. Either the victim was still alive, or someone else was in the house.
#d1010000
Either way, it means that it's more than likely that Bill Hard is innocent !
#e3320000
You are making a point, Mister Shionary.
#f1010000
Wait a second, your honor. I am far from being done. The true culprit is standing right there, in this courtroom !
#g3320000
Please tell us who you think murdered Vicky Tim !
