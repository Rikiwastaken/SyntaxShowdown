Come on, what is Mister Graph doing ? The trial is about to start... Better wait for him inside.

[May 5, 14:00, antechamber]
#4700000
(I was hoping he would be here. Better go meet the client.)
#5780000
Who might you be ? Where is Mister Graph ?
#6700000
Mister Graph should arrive soon. My name is Dick Shionary. I am his apprentice.
#7783000
His apprentice ? You look fresh out of law school !
#8700000
(Yeah, that is the point of being an apprentice...)
#9702000
Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Mister Graph should be here before long.
#a788000
I sure hope so...
#b700000
Let's go. It should start soon.
#c788000
What is going to happen to me ?
#d702000
There is no need to worry. We will do our very best to prove your innocence, Mister, huhh...
#e780000
Hard. Bill Hard.
#f700000
Right. Mister Hard.
#g788000
You don't even know who I am ?
#h705000
The clock sure is ticking, gotta go !
#i705000
(This is going to be a long day...)

#k104000
Still no signs of him, but he sent me a message.
#l615000
Hi, Dick ! It's me, Otto Graph ! Sorry, pal, but it seems I won't be able to be there for the trial. Unfortunately my cat fell in the washing machine. Don't worry I know you got this !
#m103000
This can't be happening...
#n334000
Is everything alright, Mister Shionary ?
#o103000
Well, your honor, it seems Mister Graph will not be able to be here. Do you think the trial could be postponed ?
#p421000
Do you really think your petty tricks will work ? You are only trying to buy time, you amateur !
#q330000
I apologize, Mister Shionary, but the trial will have to take place. There is no other way.
#r104000
(Damn it all, I don't even know anything about the case. I'll have to improvise.)
#s100000
In that case, I am ready, your honor.
#t421000
And so am I, your honor.
#u330000
Let us start. We are here to decide of the fate of Bill Hard, accused of the murder of his girlfriend Vicky Tim. Do you have anything to say for your defense, Mister Hard ?
#v280s20
How many times do I have to tell you ? I would never kill Vicky. I loved her.
#w288000
I loved her more than anything...
#x103000
We are here to prove that this is the truth, Mister Hard. For now, please introduce yourself.
#y280c20
My name is Bill Hard. I am a professional billiard player and I am innocent.
#z280000
We had an arguement so I left and when I came back she was...
#A288000
She was dead. Then I called the cops, and the detective arrested me.
#B101000
Wait a second, your honor. Why would Mister Hard be suspected if he is the one who discovered the body ?
#C420000
Don't you know what happened, Shionary ? Or maybe you have not studied the case ? Mister Hard is the only person who saw the victim alive. He left her house and returned a while later to call the police.
#D420000
A witness assured that no one used the victim's one and only door. No one but Mister Hard. This whole trial is pointless. There no other suspect.
#E330000
At any rate, I had a map of the crime scene drawn.
#F330002
Here it is.
#G420001
The red cross represents the corpse of the victim. The blue cross represents one of the witnesses, who stayed there all day.
#H420001
That is how we know no one entered the house between the moment when Mister Hard left and when he came back. The house to the North of the victim's is owned by another witness, Evan Quished.
#I100001
I see.
#J10400
(What kind of mess have I gotten myself into ? That is unwinable.)
#K420000
Well I suggest we do not waste any more time. Let's call the first witness.
#L330000
Are you ready, Mister Shionary ?
#M10200
More than ever, you honor.
