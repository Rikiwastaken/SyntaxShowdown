Stop !
#2240000
Come on, what is it now ?
#3102000
You just said "Bill Hard and the victim were have the most violent argument".
#4240000
So what ?
#5100000
You should have said "were having" instead of "were have".
#6420000
Do we really have to waste that much time on petty mistakes ?
#7102000
Yes we do ! A flawed testimony cannot be exploited !
#8330000
Please correct your testimony, Mister Quished.

Fine, I'll start over AGAIN.

Around 3PM, I heard screaming, can you believe that ?
#b240000
It was him ! Bill Hard and the victim were HAVING the most violent argument I had ever heard !
#c240000
I was so surprised I stopped cleaning my precious billiard balls. I like them shiny.
#d240000
I had to check it out. I was afraid of what he could have done, the monster.
#e240000
But just when I left my house. The arguing stopped. That must have been when Hard left the house.
#f240000
So I decided to hed back to my house. Those balls would not clean themselves.

(Perfect ! I have him exactly where I want.)
