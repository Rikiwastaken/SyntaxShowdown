The window was locked, but he forced it to get inside.

He was murdered inside the appartment.

There was blood on the floor, although that was to be expected.

Seeing how the furniture was turned upside down, there was a fight between the victim and his killer.

I also noticed that the window was closed when I arrived.

I examined it. The lock had been forced, and there was a fresh bloodstain on the outer side of the window frame.

Also, there was no bloodstain on Mister Gold's clothes.
