I know what you are going to say, Lawyer. How could I identify Gold if it was dark ?
#2
Yes, it was pitch black, but I know for sure that Mister Gold did it.
#3
Because I took a picture with my phone.
#4
Of course, I used a flash so the picture was bright enough.
#5
Trust me. In the picture, you can easily identify the man near the corpse.
#6
Richard Gold is /you're/ culprit !
#7
How do you like that, Mister Shionary ?
