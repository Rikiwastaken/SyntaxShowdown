I knew it ! Good old Boris, he always has my back.
#2107000
It is obvious that my client is innocent, your honor. After all, the one who killed Larry Burg must have been the one who fought with him.
#3426000
I object, your honor !
#4333000
What is it, Mister Ecution ?
#5422000
This does not prove anything. Merely that the victim fought someone.
#6102000
Yes, and that someone has to be the murderer.
#7420000
You really are amateurish, Dick Shionary !
#8421000
What I am saying is that there is no proof that this someone and Mister Gold are not the same person.
#9334000
I guess you are right, Mister Ecution.
#a420000
When you take into consideration that Mister Gold had a motive and could have taken Mister Burg by surprise, everything comes together.
#b104000
(Damn it, he is good. I am losing ground.)
#c102000
Did you take a good look at him ? Do you really think this weak man could have fought someone when he just woke up.
#d288000
Well, I would not have said it that way, Dichard, but sadly I must admit that I am not the fittest man...
#e421000
That is not all. If there was another person inside the appartment, Mister Gold woud have seen them using the door or at least leaving the appartment.
#f288000
No, that is not possible. Every door and window was locked except the one which was forced by Mister Burg.
#g104000
(Only one window ?)
#h100000
Your honor, I ask to hear the testimony one last time before hearing another witness.
#i100000
You cannot decide of the accused's culpability without hearing the other witnesses.
#j330c20
I agree, Mister Shionary. Start over, Mister Gold.
#k280000
I was in Morpheus' arms, sleeping in my room, on the third floor of my triplex.
#l280000
I woke up when I heard people fighting in the living room.
#m280000
When I walked down the stairs, still groggy, and I found a body on the ground. There was no one else to be seen.
#n280000
And then, as I was calling the police, I saw a bright flash from the window.
#o280000
While waiting for the police, I checked the door and the windows. They were all locked tight except for one.
#p280000
Believe me or not, but when the police arrived, they cuffed me ! I could not have resisted, even if I wanted to.
#q104000
(I don't see how Gold could have fought anyone. That should help me with another witness.)
