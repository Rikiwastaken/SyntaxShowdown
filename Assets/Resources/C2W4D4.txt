I think you are right, Mister Hissman. After all, Boris Neigh testified that he heard two people fighting.
#2270000
Right.
#3422000
So let me reformulate.
#4420000
You actually mean that someone fought the victim, inside the accused's very own home ?
#5424000
And to that, you add the fact that every door was locked ?
#6421000
Your honor, let us put an end to this charade. Who else but Gold could have killed Mister Burg ?
#7274000
I wouldn't be so sure.
#8270000
When I arrived, there was no blood on Mister Gold's clothes.
#9422000
This proves nothing. He merely changed clothes !
#a101000
It is your point that proves nothing, Ecution !
#b102000
You have no concrete proof that Mister Gold fought Larry Burg !
#c100000
Your honor, I think we should let Mister Hissman reformulate one last time before hearing another witness.
#d330c20
Agreed. We are listening to you, Mister Hissman.
#e270000
Thank you, your honor. Also I just remembered a small detail concerning the window.
#f270000
It looks like the victim was attempting to burglarize Mister Gold's home.
#g270000
He climbed the facade to reach his window.
#h270000
The window was locked, but he forced it to get inside.
#i270000
He was murdered inside the appartment. 
#j270000
There was blood on the floor, although that was to be expected.
#k270000
Seeing how the furniture was turned upside down, there was a fight between the victim and his killer.
#l270000
I also noticed that the window was closed when I arrived.
#m270000
I examined it. The lock had been forced, and there was a fresh bloodstain on the outer side of the window frame.
#n270000
However, as it started raining shortly after I arrived, it was washed away before I could take a sample.
#o270000
Also, there was no bloodstain on Mister Gold's clothes.
#p104000
(I don't think I can do anything else with this testimony.)
