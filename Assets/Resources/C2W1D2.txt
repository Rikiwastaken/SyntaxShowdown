Stop it right there, Witness !

What is it, Shionary ? You wish to protect your client by preventing him from confessing ?
#3280000
No need to interrupt me, Dichard. I would never confess to a crime I did not commit.
#4333000
Dichard ?
#5100000
That is not important right now, your honor.
#6104000
Mister Gold, you just said "in Morpheus's arms", didn't you ?
#7280000
I supposed I did yes. 
#8280000
I get it. This language is too sophisticated for your young mind, Dichard.
#9102000
No.
#a100000
You should have said "in Morpheus' arms", as "Morpheus" ends with an "s".
#b283000
Well, that is true.
#c332000
Scandalous ! He must be guilty for sure !
#d422000
You are right, your honor.
#e105000
I would not go to such lengths. It would be better to let the witness correct his testimony.
#f330c20
I'll allow it. Mister Gold, your testimony, if you would.

As I said, I was in Morpheus' arms, sleeping in my room, on the third floor of my triplex.
#h280000
And yet, I was awoken by some noise coming from the living room.
#i280000
When I walked down the stairs, I found a body on the ground.
#j280000
And then, as I was calling the police, I saw a bright flash from the window.
#k280000
Believe me or don't, but when the police arrived, they cuffed me !
