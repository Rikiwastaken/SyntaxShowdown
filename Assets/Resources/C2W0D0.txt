So, will Mr Graph be there today ?
#3520000
Who are your talking to, Shionary ? You imaginary boss ?
#4500000
Don't you have some innocent to persecute ? Besides he will be there today. I am sure of it.
#5526000
I hope so. Today's case is unwinnable. I almost feel sorry for you.
#6502000
We will see about that.

#8700000
Hmm, Richard Gold ?
#9781000
That will be Sir Richard Reginald Gold for you, child.
#a700000
Right.
#b700000
Anyway, my name is Dick Shionary. I am the apprentice of Mister Graph.
#c780000
Dick, the diminutive of Dichard, a rather precious and unfathomable name. Pleasure to make your aquaintance Dichard.
#d705000
The pleasure is all mine, sir. But my name is Dick.
#e788000
At any rate, would you happen to know the whereabouts of my old friend Octavius ?
#f700000
Mister Graph ? Well he should be there any minute now.
#g780000
Marvelous. I cannot wait for him to prove my innocence in the treachery.
#h700000
We will do our best, sir. Now, let's go. It is time.
#i780000
My future rests on your famelic shoulders, Dichard.

#k330000
Mister Shionary, any news of Mister Graph ?
#l100000
Let me check my phone, your honor.
#m515000
What's up, Dick. Sorry, but you'll have to manage on your own today again (sorry). There is a countrywide blackout, so I will not be able to come. Good luck.
#n103000
(How can he try something that big...)
#o105000
Well, your honor, it seems something came up. Mister Graph will not be present.
#p422000
I would bail too if I were him. This client is undefendable, Shionary !
#q336000
Well, if everyone is present, let us start.
#r330000
We are here to decide the fate of Richard Gold, accused of the murder of Larry Burg. Do you have anything to say for your defense, Mister Gold ?
#s288000
This is all preposterous ! Even if that man had broken into my haven, into my sanctum, into my cradle, I would never have laid a hand on him !
#t103000
What do you mean "broken into my haven" ?
#u281000
That man, Larry Burg, was nothing more than a burglar, a petty thief ! He broke in through my window to steal my belongings.
#v420000
The body of the victim was found inside Gold's...
#w281000
That is Mister Gold, young man !
#x426000
It was found inside Mister Gold's living room. Every door was locked and a witness saw everything from the outside.
#y421000
This case if already over. There is literaly no other suspect.
#z102000
Hold your horses, Ecution. We will not decide anything before hearing the witnesses. Your honor, if you may...
