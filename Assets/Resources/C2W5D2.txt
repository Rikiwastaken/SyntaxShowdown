How does that make any sense ?
#2421000
That is nothing more than a baseless accusation !
#3333000
How could Tess La be the killer ? She took a picture of Gold murdering the victim ?
#4100000
Let me explain, your honor.
#5100000
I will start by retracing when happened.
#6100ca0
So, during the night, Larry Burg climbed up the facade of the building, forced the window, and came in through it.
#7102000
At that point, there was a fight. Both Mister Gold and Mister Neigh's testimonies agree on this fight.
#8104000
The real question is: who fought Mister Larry Burg.
#9421000
This is amusing, Shionary, but what proves that it was not Mister Gold who killed Burg, and lied to our faces.
#a104000
Tell me, Ecution. If you were confronted with a burglar, what would be your first reaction ?
#b104000
Mine would be calling for help, and I do not remember Mister Neigh telling us he heard that.
#c101000
Now, there is one person who openly lied to us. Although she tried to pretend like it was nothing.
#d101000
Tess La hid the picture from the court, and even from you, Ecution. Why would that be ?
#e104000
It was quite an important piece of evidence, but it showed us something Tess La did not want us to see.
#f334000
And what would that be ?
#g424410
Could it be the blood ?
#h100000
Precisely. The blood on the picture is the explanation for why Hissman found blood on the oustide of the window.
#i100000
Someone used that window to leave the appartment after killing Burg, someone who had an aliby for being there.
#j100000
That person even took the time to take a picture of Gold to make us believe that he was the killer. She must have heard him run down the stairs when she was leaving.
#k100000
However she missed one thing, the bloodstain she left behind as she jumped back on her electric pole. Only one person could have done all that.
#l101000
And that person is Tess La !
#m268000
You... You...
#n261000
YOU LAWYER !
#o102000
You did it, didn't you ? Miss Tess La ?
#p260000
Of course not. I would never ! You don't have any proof. This is all stupid !
#q101000
Then answer me this: What kind on electrician would climb up an electric pole to fix some cables under heavy rain !
#r268000
I...
#s101000
You had no reason to be here, so why were you ?
#t261000
I was there to break into Gold's appartment !
#u268s20
I did it, ok ?
#v268000
You win.
#w268000
When I saw that amateur Burg, I just snapped. I had planned this operation for months, and he wanted to steal it from me.
#x268000
You got my confession. Are you happy now ?
#y100000
No I am not. But now at least an innocent man will not be convicted in your place.
#z100000
Please, your honor.
#A331000
I declare Tess La guilty of the murder of Larry Burg.
#B330000
And of course, I declare Richard Gold innocent.

#D783000
Dichard, my boy, you really did it !
#E705000
Well, I told you I would, didn't I ?
#F783000
I roam free thanks to your selfless effort.
#G700000
Still, it was close. If she had not confessed, I do not know how it would have ended.
#H705000
I was lucky in the end.
#I720000
No, it was not luck.
#J700000
Ecution ? What are you doing here ?
#K720000
I came to congratulate you. This time, you beat me for real.
#L720000
You made me realize that in my endeavor to punish criminals, I should aim for justice.
#M720000
I was trying so hard to put criminals behind bars that I almost convicted innocents.
#N720000
Thank you for stopping me. I look forward to working with you, Dick.
#O700000
Likewise, Prost.
#P790000
Thank you for Playing.
