Allow me to introduce myself. The name's Hissman, Paul Hissman. I'm the detective in charge of the case.

The accused called the police after finding the body. He told us on the phone that he had been arguing with the victim, but that he would never have killed her.

The man sounded truly shocked. He was shaking from ear to toe. He did not look like a /cold-blood/ murderer to me.

And yet, the crime scene was truly a sight to behold.
