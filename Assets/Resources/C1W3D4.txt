Wait, Mister Hissman. What did you say about the window ?
#22600000
Well, I found broken glass in the house. I thought it might be important, maybe even the murder weapon.

But upon closer inspection, it was obvious that the victim had not been cut.

No, that's not it.

What are you trying to say ?
#61000000
Well, according to Mister Reed's testimony, the glass was broken after Mister Hard left the house.

So you are telling me that the window was broken after Bill Hard left ?
#82610000
That changes everything. Actually, it reminds me of a peculiar detail.
#92610000
The hole in the window was the size of a small object, so I looked for it outside.

However, I never found it. I noticed something else. There was no broken glass outside.
#b2600000
Everything was inside the house. I don't know what to make of it.

Good thing that is your job and not mine, Mister Lawyer !

(A small object and no broken glass outside... I should be able to do something with that.)
