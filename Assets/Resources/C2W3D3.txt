This cannot be...
#2260000
Right. Can we put an end to this charade already ?
#3424000
She keeps stealing my lines...
#4101000
This cannot be. How can you make such a dumb mistake, saying "you're" instead of "your" ?
#5424c20
Shionary, aren't you missing the point here ?
#6333000
Please elaborate, Mister Ecution. I was too shocked by the mistake to listen to the rest of the testimony.
#7426005
This is the picture taken by Tess La.
#8420001
You can clearly see Mister Gold in this picture, just as she said.
#9421001
With a piece of evidence this strong, I think this trial is over.
#a334001
Mister Shionary, do you have something to say about this picture ? Because if not, I think Mister Ecution is right.
#b104001
Actually, your honor, there is something.
#c107001
What is this red stain at the corner of the picture ?
#d334001
I did not see that. Please, witness, could you explain ?
#e260511
Sure. That's blood.
#f423001
?!
#g333001
?!
#h104001
What ?
#i421001
Tess La, what are you saying ? Why didn't you tell me about it earlier ?
#j260001
It's no big deal. I cut myself while repairing the pole, just before taking the picture. I had blood on my hands.
#k101000
I ask that the witness correct her testimony to add that new piece of information !
#l330000
Please, do that, Miss La.
#m260c20
Again ? Well, fine.
#n260000
I was up on the electric pole, repairing some cables.
#o260000
Then, I cut myself. It was not severe, but it bled quite a lot.
#p260000
A few seconds later, I noticed something.
#q260000
There was a man breaking into an appartment through a window.
#r260000
I was a bit puzzled at first. But I still took a picture with my phone.
#s260000
Now that I think about it, I should have called the police.
#t260000
But you know, I was too focused on the action.
#u104000
(I can't find any mistake here.)
