Is this supposed to be some kind of sick joke ?
#2420000
Is this your last ditch effort to try to defend your client ? Accusing the witnesses ?
#3333000
Refrain from making such baseless accusations in the future, Mister Shionary.
#4100000
Please, let me explain what happened, then you'll be free to believe me or not.
#5100000
Let's start by retracing what happened.
#6100000
Mister Bill Hard visited Miss Vicky Tim's house. After a while, they started arguing. Both Evan Quished and Reed Ired heard them. Is that right, Mister Quished.
#7240000
Yeah...
#8100000
Then, Hard left the house. Reed Ired saw him. He then came back a while later, only to discover the body and call the police.
#9100000
But then, before he came back, there is the broken window.
#a101000
That means someone broke that window. Someone that is most likely not Bill Hard.
#b420000
This is a cute struggle, Shionary, but wouldn't Reed Ired have seen that suposed third party ?
#c100002
Let me show you the map we were showed earlier.
#d100003
Now, what if we added the line of sight of Mister Ired.
#e102001
As you can see, the window next to the victim is hidden from Mister Ired's line of sight. This same window which was broken from outside, as said by Mister Hissman.
#f102001
However, there is one person who should have seen that person coming. He's the owner of the house North of Miss Tim's, Evan Quished.
#g102001
Furthermore, he should have heard the broken glass, but said nothing about it.
#h333001
That is interesting, so you thing Mister Quished waitted for Bill Hard to go to burst in through the window to kill her ?
#i420001
This doesn't make any sense, she would have screamed or at least said something, and Mister Ired would have heard her.
#j100001
I never said anything about him entering through the window. I believe he threw something at the victim's head, smashing both her window and her head.
#k240000
This is ridiculous. Why would I do that ?
#l100000
Bill Hard has been your enemy for years, you merely found a way to end his career and his life.
#m240000
Preposterous. Didn't the cop said that the murder weapon was a billiard ball from inside Hard's house ?
#n100000
He found it there, but that doesn't mean it is Hard's. Weren't you cleaning your own balls just before the murder.
#o240000
That is stupid ! You really think a man could throw a stupid black ball through a window and kill someone ?
#p420000
Damn it, shut up !
#q100000
Did you just say a black ball ?
#r100000
I believe the color of the ball has not been debated during the trial. Your honor, can you us the ball found near the body.
#s333000
There is no need, Mister Shionary. The ball is indeed black.
#t100000
Your honor, the only way Evan Quished could have known the color of the ball, is if he had thrown him himself !
#u420000
This is nothing more than a coincidence.
#v100000
I don't think so, Mister Ecution. As for me, I have nothing else to say. Your honor, say your verdict.
#w333000
I declare Mister Bill Hard not guilty !

#y780s10
I can't believe it, Mister Graph. You really did it !
#z700000
Trust me I can't believe it myself. How lucky can you be to have the culprit as a witness.
#A780000
Quished... I knew he was a sore loser, but to do such a thing. And Vicky...
#B700000
Sorry about your loss.
#C780000
Thanks, but now is no time to be mopping around.
#D780000
During our arguement, I told Vicky I was thinking about stopping my career to spend more time with her.
#E780000
She told me I should never give up my dream, that I should persevere.
#F780000
I'll train even harder. I'll keep training until I am the very best, like no one ever was. I'll do it for her.
#G700000
You do that. I'll be cheering for you.
#H780000
I know you will. For now, let me pay you a drink. After all, without you I would be behind bars !
#I700000
I'm right behind you !
