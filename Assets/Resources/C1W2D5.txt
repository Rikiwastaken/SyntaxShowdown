Wait a second, Mister Jisto.
#225000
Yes ?
#310000
You said that the victim was hit with a "small round but hard object".
#425000
Correct. That is most likely the cause of death.
#510400
Do you think a billiard ball might fit the description.
#625000
Yes. Actually, now that I think about it. I couldn't find something more fitting.
#710400
Mister Hissman said in his testimony that he found a billiard ball next to the body, a very shiny one.
#842000
I see where you are going, Shionary. But a trophy was also found next to the body. This proves nothing.
#925000
No, the trophy is not the murder weapon. The wound does not fit. I do not see anything else that the billiard ball.
#a42200
So what ? The accused is a billiard champion. Of course he would have billiard balls in this house. This is pointless.
#b10000
We will see about that. Now, I would like to question another witness.
