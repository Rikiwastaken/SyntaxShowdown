Mister Shionary, is something wrong with the witness' account ?
#3107000
Yes, your honor. There is something very wrong with it.

Objection, your honor! Do not listen to this amateur. He is trying to confuse you !

Objection overruled. Please, keep going Mister Shionary.

Right. Please, Mister Quished, repeat what you told us.

Huh...
#8240000
He done it, that is all there is.

Around 3PM, I heard screaming, can you believe that ?
#k240000
It was him ! Bill Hard and the victim were have the most violent argument I had ever heard !
#l240000
I was so surprised it made me stop what I was doing.
#m240000
I had to check it out. I was afraid of what he could have done.
#n104000
(It seems he made another mistake !)
#o334000
Mister Shionary, continue your cross-examination, would you ?
