Wait, Mister Neigh.
#2256000
Just call me Boris, pal.
#3105000
Right, Mister Boris. What did you say about your wall ?
#4250000
I said "I heard some noise at the other side of my wall."
#5102000
You mean "from", don't you ?
#6253000
What ?
#7101000
You mean you heard some noise "from" the other side of your wall. Not at the other side.
#8253000
Yes, I suppose, but what does it change ?
#9105c20
Nothing, you can keep going.
#a250000
Yes. It was late at night.
#b250000
I was busy watching my favourite team on TV.
#c250000
There called the Bald Eagles.
#d250000
I was so absorbed into the game ! There was no way I would have missed it.
#e251000
And then just when they were about to score, I heard some noise from the other side of my wall.
#f250000
It was like two people were arguing.
