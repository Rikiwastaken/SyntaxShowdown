Excuse me, Mister Hissman, but you are wrong.
#2260000
What the hell is this ? Are you trying to doublecross me, boy ?
#3100000
Huh, no. It's just that you should have said "cold blooded murderer"
#4260000
Then how would you know that I am lying ?
#5330000
Are you lying, Mister Hissman ?
#6260000
Of course not. I was laying a trap for him, and you fell in it, your honor !
#73330000
Did I ?
#84220000
Please, Mister Hissman, stop trapping the judge and correct your testimony !

My apologies, he did not look like a cold-blooded murderer. He could barely align two sentences. You would have been mad, Mister Lawyer.

Anyway, the crime scene was nothing short of a complete mess. Everything was on the ground.

The victim was bathing in their own blood with a fractured skull.

I immediately looked for the kill weapon. I thought it must have been either one of trophies or one of the billiard balls.

(Well, you made me mad, Mister cop)
