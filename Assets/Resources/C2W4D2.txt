Please Dick, don't start again with this nonsense...
#2102000
Sorry, Mister Hissman, but I cannot let you say another mistake.
#3278000
Sigh...
#4274000
What did I say again ?
#5102000
You said "It look like" !
#6336000
Oh ! I know this one ! It should have been "It looks like".
#7101000
Exactly, your honor. Well done !
#8335000
Thank you, Mister Shionary.
#9422000
Stop it, Shionary ! It's not fair to flater the judge. You know how influenceable she is.

Now, keep going, Mister Hissman.
#b270000
It looks like the victim was attempting to burglarize Mister Gold's home.
#c270000
He climbed the facade to reach his window.
#d270000
The window was locked, but he forced it to get inside.
#e270000
He was murdered inside the appartment. 
#f270000
There was blood on the floor, although that was to be expected.

After all, a man losed his life.
