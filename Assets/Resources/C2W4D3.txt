Stop it, Mister Hissman, that is a mistake a first grade wouldn't do !

What is it now ?
#3100000
You said a man "losed his life". It is clearly "lost his life !"
#4270000
Being a witness with you really is an ordeal...
#5335000
I think it's not that bad.

That is part of the problem, your honor.

Ok, let's hear your new and improved testimony, Mister Hissman !
#8274c20
It looks like the victim was attempting to burglarize Mister Gold's home.
#9274000
He climbed the facade to reach his window.
#a274000
The window was locked, but he forced it to get inside.
#b274000
He was murdered inside the appartment. 
#c274000
There was blood on the floor, although that was to be expected.
#d274000
Seeing how the furniture was turned upside down, there was a fight between the victim and his killer.
#e274000
I also noticed that the window was closed when I arrived.

(Hmmmm. I don't see any mistake in his testimony...)
