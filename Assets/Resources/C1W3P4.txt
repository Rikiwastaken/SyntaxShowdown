So you are telling me that the window was broken after Bill Hard left ?
#2
That changes everything. Actually, it reminds me of a peculiar detail.
#3
The hole in the window was the size of a small object, so I looked for it outside.
#4
However, I never found it. I noticed something else. There was no broken glass outside.
#5
Everything was inside the house. I don't know what to make of it.

Good thing that is your job and not mine, Mister Lawyer !
