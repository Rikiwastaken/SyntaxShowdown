Fine, I'll start over AGAIN.
#2
Around 3PM, I heard screaming, can you believe that ?
#3
It was him ! Bill Hard and the victim were HAVING the most violent argument I had ever heard !
#4
I was so surprised I stopped cleaning my precious billiard balls. I like them shiny.
#5
I had to check it out. I was afraid of what he could have done, the monster.
#6
But just when I left my house. The arguing stopped. That must have been when Hard left the house.
#7
So I decided to /hed/ back to my house. Those balls would not clean themselves.
