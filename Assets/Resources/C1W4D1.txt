#33330000
Is that it ?
#42710000

#91020000
Please, Mister Ired, sir, I want a proper testimony !
#a1000000
I mean, please tell us what you saw in more details
#b2780000
Well, I suppose I can do that. My wife is out for groceries anyway.
#c2700000
I have to wait for her anyway, so I have really nothing better to do.
#d2780000
She told me she would be baking a cake, but she didn't have any icing.
#e2700000
So as she knew I was coming here for the trial, she thought that it would be a good occasion to buy some.
#f4220000
Will you get to the point already !
#g2780000
Sorry, I get easily sidetracked.
#h2710000
Where was I again ? Oh, that's it ! I remember !
#i2710000
I stayed outside all day. I saw everything.
#j2700000
My house is right in front of Miss Tim's, so there was not something I could miss.
#k2700000
Mister Hard is the only person who used Miss Tim's front door. I am sure of it.
#l2700000
I saw him leave the house before returning a while later. That is when he called the police.
