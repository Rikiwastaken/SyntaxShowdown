As I said, I was in Morpheus' arms, sleeping in my room, on the third floor of my triplex.

And yet, I was awoken by some noise coming from the living room.

When I walked down the stairs, I found a body on the ground.

And then, as I was calling the police, I saw a bright flash from the window.

Believe me or /don't/, but when the police arrived, they cuffed me !
