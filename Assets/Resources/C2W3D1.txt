Would you kindly introduce yourself ?

My name is Tess La. I am an electrician.
#3330000
Miss La, what exactly did you witness.
#4262000
Well, I saw everything, the whole murder.
#5107000
That doesn't make any sense, how would you be able to witness it ? Mister Gold's appartment is nowhere near the first floor.
#6264000
I was repairing an electric pole when the murder happened. The pole was close enough to Mister Gold's appartment to allow me to witness everything.

How is that, Shionary ? Shaking in your boots ?
#8105c20
(I think I am. At least a little.)
#9100000
Miss La, could you tell us what you saw in a more detailed way ? 
#a260000
I was up on the electric pole, repairing some cables, when I noticed something strange.
#b260000
There was an man breaking into an appartment through a window.
#c260000
I was a bit puzzled at first. So, I just watched.
#d260000
Now that I think about it, I should have called the police.
#e260000
But you know, I was too focused on the action.
