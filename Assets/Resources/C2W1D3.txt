You are lovely, Dichard, but are you really going to keep interrupting me ?
#2102000
I am sorry, but there is nothing more important than a flawless testimony !
#3288000
Not even proving my innocence ?
#4105000
Yes, of course that is more important.

Stop complaining. You should have said "believe me or not" instead of "believe me or don't" and that is a fact !

I wonder if I should start to thank you, Shionary. Please keep preventing your client from defending himself.

As I said, I was in Morpheus' arms, sleeping in my room, on the third floor of my triplex.

I woke up when I heard people fighting in the living room.

When I walked down the stairs, I found a body on the ground. There was no one else to be seen.

And then, as I was calling the police, I saw a bright flash from the window.

Believe me or not, but when the police arrived, they cuffed me !
