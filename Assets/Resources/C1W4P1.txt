Where was I again ? Oh, That's it ! I remember !
#2
I stayed outside all day. I saw everything.
#3
My house is right in front of Miss Tim's, so there was not /something/ I could miss.
#4
Mister Hard is the only person who used Miss Tim's front door. I am sure of it.
#5
I saw him leave the house before returning a while later. That is when he called the police.
