I was in Morpheus' arms, sleeping in my room, on the third floor of my triplex.
#2
I woke up when I heard people fighting in the living room.
#3
When I walked down the stairs, still groggy, and I found a body on the ground. There was no one else to be seen.
#4
And then, as I was calling the police, I saw a bright flash from the window.

While waiting for the police, I checked the door and the windows. They were all locked tight except for one.
#6
Believe me or not, but when the police arrived, they cuffed me ! I could not have resisted, even if I wanted to.
